# bioinformatics
Save this code in a file (e.g., bioinformatics.py) and run it. It will prompt you to enter the path to a file containing a DNA sequence. After that, it will calculate the GC content of the sequence, and then prompt you to enter a motif to search for within the sequence. Finally, it will output the positions where the motif occurs in the sequence, if any.
